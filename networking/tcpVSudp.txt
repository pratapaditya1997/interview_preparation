TCP
- connection oriented protocol. it means that communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data.
- tcp is reliable as it guarantees delivery of data to the destination router.
- tcp provides extensive error checking mechanisms.
- sequencing of data is a feature of tcp. this means that packets arrive in-order at the receiver.
- comparatively slower than UDP
- retransmission of lost packets is possible in TCP, but not in UDP.
- tcp is heavy weight

UDP
- datagram oriented protocol. there is no overhead for opening a connection. UDP is efficient for broadcast and multicast type of transmission.
- delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP.
- UDP has only the basic error checking mechanism using checksums.
- no sequencing of data. If ordering is required, it has to be managed by the application layer.
- udp is faster, simpler.
- no retransmission of lost packets.
- lightweight
- supports broadcasting

Disadvantages of UDP
- a packet may not be delivered or delivered twice, it may be delivered out of order, so we get no indication
- UDP has no congestion control & flow control.

Applications of UDP
- largely used by time sensitive applications
- used in voice over IP, online games
- compatible with packet broadcasts for sending all over the network and for multicasting sending.
- good for small transactions like DNS lookup
