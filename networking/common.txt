Q) What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
- http is unsecured while https is secured
- http sends data over port 80 while https uses port 443
- http operates at application layer while https operates at transport layer
- no ssl certificates are required for http, while https requires that you have an ssl (secure sockets layer) certificate and it is signed by a CA (certification authority)
- http doesn't require domain validation, whereas https requires at least domain validation and certain certificates even require legal document validation
