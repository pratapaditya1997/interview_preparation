Q) How to store images in a system? Is storing them in DB good?
- better to store images in file systems and store their file path only in the database.
- but there may be situations where we need ACID compliance, then storing images in database is required.
- generally it is better to avoid saving images and BLOBs in database. Also, you never want to serve images from DB, images should be served from a CDN.
- can utilise distributed file systems like GFS and HDFS
